More under a commertial environment, the practices here comprises not only the difficulties in Remote Sensing and Geoprocessing, but also the ability to perceive inconsistencies, risks, errors, which methodologies the team could be more benifited (by computational costs and time). Once identified, lines of solutions are delineated, and finally reaching the best workflow based on a certain scenario.

As System Analyst/Developer during a long period at the EMBRACE/INPE, I could learn a bit more about technologies and practices involving the professional development of big projects. Always surrounded by experient people, the EMBRACE/INPE has broght important skills that allowed me to be more prepared over a complex and dynamic field. Besides, the department also provided a wide variability of scientific topics on Astrophysics, such as Solar, Interplanetary Medium, and Earth activities, and the strategies regarding its monitoring. To go a bit through the applications that I got involved, I listed and explaned below each of them.

Ionospheric scintillation is a rapid variation of amplitude and phase of radio wave signals and occurs when these signals traverse the irregularities of the ionosphere. In practical terms, this...
